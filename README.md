# StoryLab Academy
The website for the StoryLab Academy, which hosts a set of online courses / webinars for digital journalism, along with communities that host physical meetups and workshops to improve digital skills in African newsrooms.

The Academy is a partnership between Code for Africa, the Google News Lab, the World Bank, and Hacks/Hackers Africa.

The website is based on the NewsImpact.io template by the European Journalism Centre (EJC).
