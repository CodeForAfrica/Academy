            <h2>What is <br />academy.AFRICA?</h2>

            <p class="lead">
              Journalism is evolving so quickly that newsrooms are struggling to
              keep up.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The academy seeks to help, by bringing face-to-face training into
              partner newsrooms across Africa, and by hosting public workshops
              at monthly Hacks/Hackers meetups.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The academy will also offer online courses and webinars, designed
              to teach just one tool or technique at a time, so participants can
              upgrade their skills at their own pace.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The training will be spearheaded by the continentâ€™s largest
              digital journalism network,
