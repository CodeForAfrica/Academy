            <h2>What is the<br/>StoryLab Academy?</h2>

            <p>Journalism is evolving so quickly that newsrooms are struggling to keep up.</p>
            <p>The StoryLab Academy seeks to help, by bringing face-to-face training into partner newsrooms across Africa, and by hosting public workshops at monthly Hacks/Hackers meetups.</p>
            <p>The Academy will also offer online courses and webinars, designed to teach just one tool or technique at a time, so participants can upgrade their skills at their own pace.</p>
            <p>The training will be spearheaded by the continentâ€™s largest digital journalism network, <a href="https://codeforafrica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Code for Africa</strong></a>, with support from the <a href="https://newslab.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google NewsLab</strong></a> and <a href="http://worlbank.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>World Bank</strong></a>.</p>
