Africa is a big place, and the 12 cities we’re targeting for our first wave of physical workshops are just the proverbial tip of the iceberg. 
 
The StoryLab Academy will therefore launch a Mass Open Online Course (MOOC) in August for journalists anywhere in Africa.
 
Participation will be free-of-charge, with course modules beginning with Web Fundamentals to give basic digital skills for newsrooms, alongside more advanced specialist tracks for data journalists, investigative reporters, geo-journalists and multimedia storytelling.
 
There will also be standalone modules on news verification / digital fact-checking to help journalist’s combat fake news, as well as digital security modules to help keep journalists and their sources safe.
 
Lessons will include video explainers, concise tip-sheets and exercises to immediately try out new skills. Participants will be able to tailor courses to their most pressing needs, by mixing and matching modules. Journalists who need help fast, while on deadline, will be able to learn the exact tool they need in minutes.
