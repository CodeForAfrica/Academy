## What is the StoryLab Academy?

<p class="lead"><em>The StoryLab Academy brings together the best of Google, the World Bank, and Code for Africa’s data journalism resources and technology to support high-quality journalism in Africa.</em></p>
 
For journalists, recent advances in digital technology present compelling new opportunities to discover, tell, and share stories. But learning how to use new digital tools for reporting can be daunting. This is particularly true in Africa where digital integration in news and storytelling often remains a challenge. Across the continent, few journalism institutions offer training programs in digital tools and news organization lack the capability to leverage new digital technologies in their reporting.    
 
The StoryLab Academy offers journalists across Africa training in skills like mobile reporting, mapping, data visualization, verification, new forms of storytelling, and fact checking. In partnership with the World Bank, [Code For Africa](https://codeforafrica.org/), and Google, the digital journalism initiative aims to train more than 6,000 journalists across the region before the end of 2017. 
 
Over the next seven months, journalists in 11 major African cities: Abuja, Lagos, Nairobi, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Casablanca, Dakar, Freetown, Dar es Salaam, Kampala, and Yaounde will be trained on digital journalism skills. By providing the necessary instruction and support to better use digital tools available to them, we hope to empower journalists across the continent to produce innovative and compelling reporting.
